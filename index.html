        <h2>Day 1</h2>
        <p>
          I'm trying to start a dedicated 8 hours everyday into undistracted
          (phones away) coding for 4 months, i want to see something
        </p>
        <p>i'll try to record as much as i can in between intervals</p>
        <p>
          starting the first day at 11pm, i'll be working on my decoder
          project(caesar shift)
        </p>
        <p>
          At 1:48 after a couple of hours, not even up to 4 hours, i had to turn
          my computer off because i was feeling sleepy.
        </p>
        <p>I need to go sleep and come back stronger for Day 2</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 2 (officially Day I)</h2>
        <p>I went to physical therapy</p>
        <p>I'm giving tired eyes a run for it's money.</p>
        <p>
          I'll be working on the decoder project(polybius square). Starting time
          12:22am
        </p>
        <p>
          Made a cup of chamomile tea and all of a sudden I'm starting to get
          energy
        </p>
        <p>
          It's 6:50am and i'm still here trying to solve the polybius square
        </p>
        <p>
          The hard thing i noticed about studying at this time is the help be
          scarce because majority of the helpers are asleep
        </p>
        <p>
          I even have my coffee out now, i had to get it to be able to stay up
          this time
        </p>
        <p>
          Gradually falling back to my old-habit of driniking coffee regularly
        </p>
        <p>
          It's 8:00am, i finally got the polybius square code to run, but i
          don't understand some parts of the working code.
        </p>
        <p>This is it for Day 2, i need to go reset my brain with some rest</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 3 (officially day II)</h2>
        <p>Starting day II as a typical 9-5 shift</p>
        <p>
          I'll be working on the decoder project (substitution cipher). I have
          to conclude the decoder project today. So help me God.
        </p>
        <p>It's 5:14pm and i'm done with today's shift lol</p>
        <p>
          I'm still learning how to add a live date and time feature on this
          page. Soon Come, Soon come!!
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally finished my decoder project, feels good to be free from that,
          it was a fight to get that project to work properly
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally able to continue studying my course work with
          <strong>Thinkful Bootcamp</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I learnt about synchronous and asynchronous code, and also started
          learning promises (how to create and resolve).
        </p>
        <p>Another shift in the books, way to go boy!</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 4 (officially day III)</h2>
        <p>This is the beginning of the year 2022, I must say i'm excited!!!</p>
        <p>
          I am ready to go for it and make my dreams come true, taking it one
          day at a time, giving it all that i've got every moment i can
        </p>
        <p>Starting day III at 12pm and hoping to end at 8pm</p>
        <p>I'll be going through my course work from Bootcamp!</p>
        <p>
          Ending today's shift now and i'm glad to see this through today
          because it wasn't the best shift, but it's in the books now
        </p>
        <p>
          I also watched a couple youtube videos on Promises and asynchronous
          code
        </p>
        <p>
          Still learning promises and learning how to use the then() and
          catch().
        </p>
        <p>I'll get back to it on my next shift</p>
        <p>
          So far I have done the midnight shift, morning shift, and afternoon
          shift.. I must say the morning shift is winning right now.. But it's
          only day III haha
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 5 (officially day IV)</h2>
        <p>
          Starting today's shift a little late, i was second-guessing if i
          should go on today or not lol
        </p>
        <p>Glad i had the balls to put in today's shift.</p>
        <p>
          Starting at 8pm, i'll be working on Promises and i'll also be getting
          user's suggestion for my personal project.
        </p>
        <p>Today's session was a good one</p>
        <p>
          Even though it started as shaky, this session has happened to be my
          best one yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          I completed working on Promise and eventually moved on to making web
          requests
        </p>
        <p>
          One powerful takeaway from today's session is always to go back to
          revise what i learnt from the previous session
        </p>
        <p>
          The things i went back to revise happen to make more sense than the
          first day i actually learnt about it
        </p>
        <p>Ending today's/tonight's session on a wonderful note!</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 6 (officially day V)</h2>
        <p>
          Starting today's shift at 7am, i think i'll stick to the morning
          routine, it works best for me.
        </p>
        <p>I have to learn to sleep at night and work in the morning.</p>
        <p>
          I have this fresh energy in the mornings that i wanna keep and stay
          consistent with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The plan today is to finsish all of my due course from Bootcamp.
          LFG!!!!
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll be putting in extra hours later on today because i still have not
          finished all of my due course
        </p>
        <p>I finally made up my mind to stick with the morning shift.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 7 (officially day VI)</h2>
        <p>
          I'll be starting today at 10:30am. I'll be working on Modern
          asynchronous programming
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a mock interview coming up in the Bootcamp, that means i need
          to get my practice on.
        </p>
        <p>
          I woke up this morning feeling super grateful for another opportunity
          to go another day of this shift, so help me God! Let's get it!!
        </p>
        <p>
          While in the middle of shift, i hopped into a study group on Discord
          and i felt super motivated again to keep studying!!
        </p>
        <p>
          I also learnt a few practice techniques from Muhammed,a Thinkful
          mentor, on how to make what you learn stick
        </p>
        <p>Clocking out at 7:03pm, it's been a good day!</p>
        <p>I networked and also learnt some new learning techniques</p>
        <p>
          I also completed the Modern asynchronous programming module, whoooof,
          i'll need to revisit this module till i get a hang of the concepts
        </p>
        <p>Another day in the books, Thank you God!</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 8(officially day VII)</h2>
        <p>
          I'm starting today at 11am. I'll be working on my courses from
          Bootcamp and also doing a prep for the mock interview with my mentor
        </p>
        <p>
          For today's session, I'll be starting with a revision of Modern
          asynchronous programming, and will move on from there
        </p>
        <p>
          So far so good, i got to help someone solve a broken code and i feel
          proud
        </p>
        <p>
          Just understanding the concepts and being able to explain it to
          another person shows how far i came with coding. Feeling accomplished
          for today already
        </p>
        <p>I finally realized the true reason behind me learning to coding</p>
        <p>
          I consider myself an artist and a thinker lol, i think a lot, majorly
          about what needs to be done and how it can be done. I guess this is
          where my problem-solving skills come from.
        </p>
        <p>
          Programming gives me an ability to express my thoughts. In a way
          bringing my imaginations to life.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this somehow shows how i think - because i can only program or
          create my thoughts and when it comes to life, i can then gauge how i
          think or how im thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally realizing this reason just gave me so much energy to keep
          going!!!
        </p>
        <p>
          Clocking out today's shift 23 mins earlier than the expected time..
          super hungry at this hour.
        </p>
        <p>Another day in the books!!!</p>
        <p>
          After discovering the real reason i'm learning to code, i hope and
          pray to keep this energy alive!! So help me God.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 9 (officially day VIII)</h2>
        <p>Starting today at 10am. I woke up with the right mindset today.</p>
        <p>Normally, it's always a fight between right mindset and "tired".</p>
        <p>
          Even though most times the right mindset always prevails, i find today
          different. I woke up with the right mindset automatically today!
        </p>
        <p>Today i'll be starting with practicing web requests</p>
        <p>Ending today's shift at 6pm.</p>
        <p>
          I practiced web request and i'm starting to understand more concepts
          that were originally confusing to me at first.
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked on some Courses that are due too. One step at a time, One day
          at a time. Progress is definite!
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm starting to get comfortable with little progress made; starting to
          see that after little comes Big lol
        </p>
        <p>Another shift in the books. Thank you God!</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 10 (officially day IX)</h2>
        <p>Starting today at 2:55pm, afternoon shift</p>
        <p>
          I was contemplating putting in today's hours in or nahh majorly
          because my eyes started bothering me, giving me all type of scare.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was wondering to myself, have i been staring at the screen too much?
          or what can be the cause of this discomfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that moment i said to myself, this is one of those days where i
          wake up in the fights between "the right mindset" vs "tiredness". And
          so far the right mindet always prevail. So i'm going to get up, dim my
          computer brightness, and add today to another "right mindset" victory
        </p>
        <p>
          I opened up my laptop and made a google search on "what are the
          effects of staring at the screen for hours?" The answers i found
          weren't that intimidating. Thank God
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll be practicing web requests again today. And move on to complete
          some of the modules that are due from my Bootcamp course
        </p>
        <p>I learnt a few things about Networking today.</p>
        <p>I'll be clocking out of today's shift at 11:16pm</p>
        <p>
          And i also learnt that tracking the amount of work done > tracking
          time.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 11 (officially day X)</h2>
        <p>Today i'm starting my shift at 3pm, afternoon shift</p>
        <p>I'll be starting with continuing my coursework from Bootcamp</p>
        <p>
          I did an informational interview today with the great Hidekazu Shidara
          and this was more than an interview
        </p>
        <p>
          He constantly gave me informations needed to succeed in this field.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even after the interview, he constantly kept the informations coming
          in and i'm glad i spoke to a gentleman like Hide for my first
          informational interview.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clocking out the shift at 11:00pm, but i'll be staying to put in some
          extra work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm glad through this journey so far, whenever i try to feel tired, i
          get a booster.
        </p>
        <p>Another shift in the books. Thank you God</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 12 (officially day XI)</h2>

        </p>
        <p>Today is what i call enlightenment day</p>
        <p>
          Enlightenment day is the day i finally decided to change my studying
          strategy
        </p>
        <p>
          I finally found a technique to accomplish the "tracking the amount of
          work done > tracking the amount of time"
        </p>
        <p>
          Enlightenment day goes like this: For every shift, i'll make a list of
          work that needs to be done for that shift and i won't sleep till the
          task is completed. And the task must be an 8 hour worthy task i.e If
          the required task is completed under 8 hours, add to the task
        </p>
        <div class="task">
          <h3>Task of the day</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Complete the frontend foundations assessment project</li>
            <li>Complete all due coursework!</li>

          Enlightenment day I: started without a proper strategy, i spent over 5
          hours on the frontend foundations assessment project trying to figure
          out how to make the page come out as intended. Still haven't gotten it
          right
        </p>
        <p>
          I wasn't able to complete all due coursework, but i will complete it
          during the next session when i apply the proper technique for
          enlightenment day. We live and learn
        </p>
        <p>Another day in the books. Thank you God!</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 17 (officially day XVI)</h2>
        <p>
          Clocking in at 7pm, I'll be working with a new strategy on
          Enlightenment.
        </p>
        <p>The new strategy is as follows:</p>
        <div class="strategy">
          <h3 id="task">Task of the day</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Complete all due coursework!</li>
            <li>
              Finish up the frontend foundations assesment project: building a
              website called ThinfulBnB with just HTML and CSS
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          Yes as seen above, the strategy is to catch up with every due
          coursework because it compounds for everyday i'm stuck working on a
          project
        </p>
        <p>
          In short, coursework before projects! Most importantly
          <a href="#task">Task of the day</a> must be completed
        </p>
        <p>
          Another 8 hours in and both due coursework and frontend assessment not
          completed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I realized i spend too much time trying to figure things out myself
          and it's been slowing me down, i'll get back to asking questions when
          i spend too much time on a problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's hard getting help during night hours too lol. I'll find a way to
          make this work.
        </p>
        <p>All work must be completed in the next shift!</p>
      </div>

        <p>
          It's 2 months in and 1 week into bootcamp and i started questioning
          myself, i really dont know where that feeling came from.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe it's because of how the day has been going around me (this would
          be a story for another day)
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing i know is i'll pick myself up daily because i have a
          destination to be at and nothing would stop me from getting there
        </p>
        <div class="task">

          I watched a couple videos on how to learn bu i'm still not done with
          the due coursework haha
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm now worried about understanding these concepts as i move on rather
          than completing them quickly... i think this is why i still haven't
          completed this due coursework
        </p>
        <p>It must happen sometime this week for sure!</p>

          using react?🤔
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a couple more lessons in the react phase of Bootcamp.. Maybe by
          the time i'm done,that decision would be clearer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have therapy today, so i'd be using up the hours before therapy
          because i often tend to be tired after therapy.

          Today is another day to go for it and i have a new strategy.. yes i'll
          keep testing strategies till i get the one that works for me
        </p>
        <p>The new strategy goes as follows:</p>
        <div class="strategy">
          <ol>
            <li>Break the 8 hours into 4 quarters</li>
            <li>One quarter would be 2 hours</li>
            <li>
              Each quarter would be a flow state session of 1hr 50mins and a 10
              mins Break
            </li>
            <li>
              Each quarter would be tied to a task that needs to be completed
              within that quater
            </li>
            <li>
              If a task is not completed within its assigned quarter, Move on to
              the next task
            </li>
            <li>
              For uncompleted tasks, find time within another quarter to
              complete it after that quarter's assigned task has been completed
            </li>
            <li>A task can be assigned to one or more quater.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>
          This is the new strategy for now lol.. If a new one comes up, it'll be
          updated lol.

          Started feeling this sharp pain in my right eye... I need to go see an
          optometrist ASAP
        </p>
        <p>
          It's been a back and forth thing.. i finally need to go seek help from
          the professionals
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway i'll be doing today's shift with very low brightness, i'd have
          to strain my eyes a little bit more but a man has to do what he has to
          do.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll be working for 2 quarters tonight and i'll be working on

          Planned to go for 2 quarters but seeing out for 3 now lol... i finally
          completed CSS frameworks(bootstrap) project. I got 5 out of 6 tests to
          pass with the react state management project... I'll be needing help
          for that last test, tried all i know lol
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll be resting my eyes now, this is not comfortable at all...
          hopefully, i'll wake up with a brand new eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost skipped today's shift because of this eye but i'm glad i could
          come in to get things done.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today is a calm day and i'm refreshed to go complete these projects

          I have another added strategy to help with retaining what i'm learning
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Jim kwik, primalcy and recency are fundamental blocks for
          retaining information learnt... I'll be using the pomodoro technique
          for 35 mins straight focus and 5 mins interval.

          bootcamp projects too ofc
        </p>
        <p>
          I read an article from an expert that said "build to learn", since i
          still have a lot to learn, i guess it's time i started one of my
          projects and ultimately complete it before the end of the month

        <p>
          Today i'm moving on a different wave just because i started reading
          the book "Feel the fear... And do it anyway" by Susan Jeffers
        </p>
        <p>
          Funny how lately i've been feeling this fear to work on some projects
          and deep down i know these projects will improve my learning
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank God i had the courage to pick up that book, i feel the need to
          start working on these projects and i'll start the work as soon as
          possible

          Clocking out half-shift at 11pm, the styling for BOARD is eventually

        </p>
        <p>
          Looking like i'll be going to bootstrap for the layout.. The bootsrap
          reseach starts the next time i'm working on BOARD

          need to get done, with or without fear, I'm doing it anyways

        <p>Clocking out this shift at 9:45pm ...</p>
        <p>
          I actually deviated from the today's task and learnt creative coding
          for majority of the day and i enjoyed it.. I'll be completing the
          creative coding course this week.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think the creative coding sets my mood right, something about
          sketching with code seems so fascinating to me, maybe that's because
          i've always want to be an artist that paints with brush and this gives
          me that feel...
        </p>
        <p>
          I can feel the creative side of me coming out with the sketches i
          learnt today and using a canvas? makes me feel like picasso lol..
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to finish the course today but it was an impromptu task, i
          actually stumbled on the course because i needed a feel of what i
          won't get bored of and that course came through today.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started my Recipe Tracking App today and i'll be completing it
          tomorrow.. I'll try to complete it first before doing the creative
          coding.

          With the way i started the session, i didn't know i was going to stay
          this long
        </p>
        <p>Clocking out at 1:20am...</p>
        <p>Completed today's task, started the flashcard app.</p>
        <p>
          Flashcard App looking like big work so far.. maybe it's because of the
          mood i started the project in
        </p>
        <p>
          I know i'll be in a much improved mood for the next session, i'll
          continue with it and most likely will have a different view.
        </p>
        <p>Another day in the books, Thank you God!</p>

        <p>
          I realize that the goal is to be able to teach someone how to code
          rather than getting a job in tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that brings me to this affirmation: I will break into the tech
          industry in less than 6 months from now.

          This morning, i woke up to another episode of "The struggles of where

        <p>
          The light went off again: after the storm last night, the light in the

          normally go..
        </p>

          The good thing about this is, I am reminded again why i gotta give
