        <h2>Day 1</h2>
        <p>
          I'm trying to start a dedicated 8 hours everyday into undistracted
          (phones away) coding for 4 months, i want to see something
        </p>
        <p>i'll try to record as much as i can in between intervals</p>
        <p>
          starting the first day at 11pm, i'll be working on my decoder
          project(caesar shift)
        </p>
        <p>
          At 1:48 after a couple of hours, not even up to 4 hours, i had to turn
          my computer off because i was feeling sleepy.
        </p>
        <p>I need to go sleep and come back stronger for Day 2</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 2 (officially Day I)</h2>
        <p>I went to physical therapy</p>
        <p>I'm giving tired eyes a run for it's money.</p>
        <p>
          I'll be working on the decoder project(polybius square). Starting time
          12:22am
        </p>
        <p>
          Made a cup of chamomile tea and all of a sudden I'm starting to get
          energy
        </p>
        <p>
          It's 6:50am and i'm still here trying to solve the polybius square
        </p>
        <p>
          The hard thing i noticed about studying at this time is the help be
          scarce because majority of the helpers are asleep
        </p>
        <p>
          I even have my coffee out now, i had to get it to be able to stay up
          this time
        </p>
        <p>
          Gradually falling back to my old-habit of driniking coffee regularly
        </p>
        <p>
          It's 8:00am, i finally got the polybius square code to run, but i
          don't understand some parts of the working code.
        </p>
        <p>This is it for Day 2, i need to go reset my brain with some rest</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 3 (officially day II)</h2>
        <p>Starting day II as a typical 9-5 shift</p>
        <p>
          I'll be working on the decoder project (substitution cipher). I have
          to conclude the decoder project today. So help me God.
        </p>
        <p>It's 5:14pm and i'm done with today's shift lol</p>
        <p>
          I'm still learning how to add a live date and time feature on this
          page. Soon Come, Soon come!!
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally finished my decoder project, feels good to be free from that,
          it was a fight to get that project to work properly
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally able to continue studying my course work with
          <strong>Thinkful Bootcamp</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I learnt about synchronous and asynchronous code, and also started
          learning promises (how to create and resolve).
        </p>
        <p>Another shift in the books, way to go boy!</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 4 (officially day III)</h2>
        <p>This is the beginning of the year 2022, I must say i'm excited!!!</p>
        <p>
          I am ready to go for it and make my dreams come true, taking it one
          day at a time, giving it all that i've got every moment i can
        </p>
        <p>Starting day III at 12pm and hoping to end at 8pm</p>
        <p>I'll be going through my course work from Bootcamp!</p>
        <p>
          Ending today's shift now and i'm glad to see this through today
          because it wasn't the best shift, but it's in the books now
        </p>
        <p>
          I also watched a couple youtube videos on Promises and asynchronous
          code
        </p>
        <p>
          Still learning promises and learning how to use the then() and
          catch().
        </p>
        <p>I'll get back to it on my next shift</p>
        <p>
          So far I have done the midnight shift, morning shift, and afternoon
          shift.. I must say the morning shift is winning right now.. But it's
          only day III haha
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 5 (officially day IV)</h2>
        <p>
          Starting today's shift a little late, i was second-guessing if i
          should go on today or not lol
        </p>
        <p>Glad i had the balls to put in today's shift.</p>
        <p>
          Starting at 8pm, i'll be working on Promises and i'll also be getting
          user's suggestion for my personal project.
        </p>
        <p>Today's session was a good one</p>
        <p>
          Even though it started as shaky, this session has happened to be my
          best one yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          I completed working on Promise and eventually moved on to making web
          requests
        </p>
        <p>
          One powerful takeaway from today's session is always to go back to
          revise what i learnt from the previous session
        </p>
        <p>
          The things i went back to revise happen to make more sense than the
          first day i actually learnt about it
        </p>
        <p>Ending today's/tonight's session on a wonderful note!</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 6 (officially day V)</h2>
        <p>
          Starting today's shift at 7am, i think i'll stick to the morning
          routine, it works best for me.
        </p>
        <p>I have to learn to sleep at night and work in the morning.</p>
        <p>
          I have this fresh energy in the mornings that i wanna keep and stay
          consistent with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The plan today is to finsish all of my due course from Bootcamp.
          LFG!!!!
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll be putting in extra hours later on today because i still have not
          finished all of my due course
        </p>
        <p>I finally made up my mind to stick with the morning shift.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 7 (officially day VI)</h2>
        <p>
          I'll be starting today at 10:30am. I'll be working on Modern
          asynchronous programming
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a mock interview coming up in the Bootcamp, that means i need
          to get my practice on.
        </p>
        <p>
          I woke up this morning feeling super grateful for another opportunity
          to go another day of this shift, so help me God! Let's get it!!
        </p>
        <p>
          While in the middle of shift, i hopped into a study group on Discord
          and i felt super motivated again to keep studying!!
        </p>
        <p>
          I also learnt a few practice techniques from Muhammed,a Thinkful
          mentor, on how to make what you learn stick
        </p>
        <p>Clocking out at 7:03pm, it's been a good day!</p>
        <p>I networked and also learnt some new learning techniques</p>
        <p>
          I also completed the Modern asynchronous programming module, whoooof,
          i'll need to revisit this module till i get a hang of the concepts
        </p>
        <p>Another day in the books, Thank you God!</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 8(officially day VII)</h2>
        <p>
          I'm starting today at 11am. I'll be working on my courses from
          Bootcamp and also doing a prep for the mock interview with my mentor
        </p>
        <p>
          For today's session, I'll be starting with a revision of Modern
          asynchronous programming, and will move on from there
        </p>
        <p>
          So far so good, i got to help someone solve a broken code and i feel
          proud
        </p>
        <p>
          Just understanding the concepts and being able to explain it to
          another person shows how far i came with coding. Feeling accomplished
          for today already
        </p>
        <p>I finally realized the true reason behind me learning to coding</p>
        <p>
          I consider myself an artist and a thinker lol, i think a lot, majorly
          about what needs to be done and how it can be done. I guess this is
          where my problem-solving skills come from.
        </p>
        <p>
          Programming gives me an ability to express my thoughts. In a way
          bringing my imaginations to life.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this somehow shows how i think - because i can only program or
          create my thoughts and when it comes to life, i can then gauge how i
          think or how im thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally realizing this reason just gave me so much energy to keep
          going!!!
        </p>
        <p>
          Clocking out today's shift 23 mins earlier than the expected time..
          super hungry at this hour.
        </p>
        <p>Another day in the books!!!</p>
        <p>
          After discovering the real reason i'm learning to code, i hope and
          pray to keep this energy alive!! So help me God.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 9 (officially day VIII)</h2>
        <p>Starting today at 10am. I woke up with the right mindset today.</p>
        <p>Normally, it's always a fight between right mindset and "tired".</p>
        <p>
          Even though most times the right mindset always prevails, i find today
          different. I woke up with the right mindset automatically today!
        </p>
        <p>Today i'll be starting with practicing web requests</p>
        <p>Ending today's shift at 6pm.</p>
        <p>
          I practiced web request and i'm starting to understand more concepts
          that were originally confusing to me at first.
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked on some Courses that are due too. One step at a time, One day
          at a time. Progress is definite!
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm starting to get comfortable with little progress made; starting to
          see that after little comes Big lol
        </p>
        <p>Another shift in the books. Thank you God!</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 10 (officially day IX)</h2>
        <p>Starting today at 2:55pm, afternoon shift</p>
        <p>
          I was contemplating putting in today's hours in or nahh majorly
          because my eyes started bothering me, giving me all type of scare.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was wondering to myself, have i been staring at the screen too much?
          or what can be the cause of this discomfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that moment i said to myself, this is one of those days where i
          wake up in the fights between "the right mindset" vs "tiredness". And
          so far the right mindet always prevail. So i'm going to get up, dim my
          computer brightness, and add today to another "right mindset" victory
        </p>
        <p>
          I opened up my laptop and made a google search on "what are the
          effects of staring at the screen for hours?" The answers i found
          weren't that intimidating. Thank God
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll be practicing web requests again today. And move on to complete
          some of the modules that are due from my Bootcamp course
        </p>
        <p>I learnt a few things about Networking today.</p>
        <p>I'll be clocking out of today's shift at 11:16pm</p>
        <p>
          And i also learnt that tracking the amount of work done > tracking
          time.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 11 (officially day X)</h2>
        <p>Today i'm starting my shift at 3pm, afternoon shift</p>
        <p>I'll be starting with continuing my coursework from Bootcamp</p>
        <p>
          I did an informational interview today with the great Hidekazu Shidara
          and this was more than an interview
        </p>
        <p>
          He constantly gave me informations needed to succeed in this field.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even after the interview, he constantly kept the informations coming
          in and i'm glad i spoke to a gentleman like Hide for my first
          informational interview.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clocking out the shift at 11:00pm, but i'll be staying to put in some
          extra work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm glad through this journey so far, whenever i try to feel tired, i
          get a booster.
        </p>
        <p>Another shift in the books. Thank you God</p>
