        <h2>Day 1</h2>
        <p>
          I'm trying to start a dedicated 8 hours everyday into undistracted
          (phones away) coding for 4 months, i want to see something
        </p>
        <p>i'll try to record as much as i can in between intervals</p>
        <p>
          starting the first day at 11pm, i'll be working on my decoder
          project(caesar shift)
        </p>
        <p>
          At 1:48 after a couple of hours, not even up to 4 hours, i had to turn
          my computer off because i was feeling sleepy.
        </p>
        <p>I need to go sleep and come back stronger for Day 2</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 2 (officially Day I)</h2>
        <p>I went to physical therapy</p>
        <p>I'm giving tired eyes a run for it's money.</p>
        <p>
          I'll be working on the decoder project(polybius square). Starting time
          12:22am
        </p>
        <p>
          Made a cup of chamomile tea and all of a sudden I'm starting to get
          energy
        </p>
        <p>
          It's 6:50am and i'm still here trying to solve the polybius square
        </p>
        <p>
          The hard thing i noticed about studying at this time is the help be
          scarce because majority of the helpers are asleep
        </p>
        <p>
          I even have my coffee out now, i had to get it to be able to stay up
          this time
        </p>
        <p>
          Gradually falling back to my old-habit of driniking coffee regularly
        </p>
        <p>
          It's 8:00am, i finally got the polybius square code to run, but i
          don't understand some parts of the working code.
        </p>
        <p>This is it for Day 2, i need to go reset my brain with some rest</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 3 (officially day II)</h2>
        <p>Starting day II as a typical 9-5 shift</p>
        <p>
          I'll be working on the decoder project (substitution cipher). I have
          to conclude the decoder project today. So help me God.
        </p>
        <p>It's 5:14pm and i'm done with today's shift lol</p>
        <p>
          I'm still learning how to add a live date and time feature on this
          page. Soon Come, Soon come!!
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally finished my decoder project, feels good to be free from that,
          it was a fight to get that project to work properly
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally able to continue studying my course work with
          <strong>Thinkful Bootcamp</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I learnt about synchronous and asynchronous code, and also started
          learning promises (how to create and resolve).
        </p>
        <p>Another shift in the books, way to go boy!</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 4 (officially day III)</h2>
        <p>This is the beginning of the year 2022, I must say i'm excited!!!</p>
        <p>
          I am ready to go for it and make my dreams come true, taking it one
          day at a time, giving it all that i've got every moment i can
        </p>
        <p>Starting day III at 12pm and hoping to end at 8pm</p>
        <p>I'll be going through my course work from Bootcamp!</p>
        <p>
          Ending today's shift now and i'm glad to see this through today
          because it wasn't the best shift, but it's in the books now
        </p>
        <p>
          I also watched a couple youtube videos on Promises and asynchronous
          code
        </p>
        <p>
          Still learning promises and learning how to use the then() and
          catch().
        </p>
        <p>I'll get back to it on my next shift</p>
        <p>
          So far I have done the midnight shift, morning shift, and afternoon
          shift.. I must say the morning shift is winning right now.. But it's
          only day III haha
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 5 (officially day IV)</h2>
        <p>
          Starting today's shift a little late, i was second-guessing if i
          should go on today or not lol
        </p>
        <p>Glad i had the balls to put in today's shift.</p>
        <p>
          Starting at 8pm, i'll be working on Promises and i'll also be getting
          user's suggestion for my personal project.
        </p>
        <p>Today's session was a good one</p>
        <p>
          Even though it started as shaky, this session has happened to be my
          best one yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          I completed working on Promise and eventually moved on to making web
          requests
        </p>
        <p>
          One powerful takeaway from today's session is always to go back to
          revise what i learnt from the previous session
        </p>
        <p>
          The things i went back to revise happen to make more sense than the
          first day i actually learnt about it
        </p>
        <p>Ending today's/tonight's session on a wonderful note!</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 6 (officially day V)</h2>
        <p>
          Starting today's shift at 7am, i think i'll stick to the morning
          routine, it works best for me.
        </p>
        <p>I have to learn to sleep at night and work in the morning.</p>
        <p>
          I have this fresh energy in the mornings that i wanna keep and stay
          consistent with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The plan today is to finsish all of my due course from Bootcamp.
          LFG!!!!
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll be putting in extra hours later on today because i still have not
          finished all of my due course
        </p>
        <p>I finally made up my mind to stick with the morning shift.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 7 (officially day VI)</h2>
        <p>
          I'll be starting today at 10:30am. I'll be working on Modern
          asynchronous programming
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a mock interview coming up in the Bootcamp, that means i need
          to get my practice on.
        </p>
        <p>
          I woke up this morning feeling super grateful for another opportunity
          to go another day of this shift, so help me God! Let's get it!!
        </p>
        <p>
          While in the middle of shift, i hopped into a study group on Discord
          and i felt super motivated again to keep studying!!
        </p>
        <p>
          I also learnt a few practice techniques from Muhammed,a Thinkful
          mentor, on how to make what you learn stick
        </p>
        <p>Clocking out at 7:03pm, it's been a good day!</p>
        <p>I networked and also learnt some new learning techniques</p>
        <p>
          I also completed the Modern asynchronous programming module, whoooof,
          i'll need to revisit this module till i get a hang of the concepts
        </p>
        <p>Another day in the books, Thank you God!</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Day 8(officially day VII)</h2>
        <p>
          I'm starting today at 11am. I'll be working on my courses from
          Bootcamp and also doing a prep for the mock interview with my mentor
        </p>
        <p>
          For today's session, I'll be starting with a revision of Modern
          asynchronous programming, and will move on from there
